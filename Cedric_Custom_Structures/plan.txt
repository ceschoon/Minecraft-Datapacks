Types of structures to add:
===========================

Towers (small and medium)
--> Spawn pillagers around them

Huts (small)

Houses and abandoned houses (medium)

Crafting area/Abandoned camp site (small)

Castles and Barracks (medium to large)
--> Use village template to generate several structures around?
    (watch towers, fields, training sites, etc.)

Dungeons (medium to large)
--> Various entrances (towers, hidden trapdoors, etc.)

Graves (small)
--> With valuables to dig??
--> Some kind of curse/only cursed items

Cursed ruins with permanent cloud effect

Pyramid
--> custom rooms randomly generated
--> dungeon underneath? (not always?)
    ! would require rooms with at least 2 jigsaw blocks, 
      and thus a separate collection of rooms
--> both desert, mesa and jungle versions?
    (make red sandstone and stonebricks variants when desert is finished)
--> spawn husk inside (desert) or regular zombies (jungle)

tellraw @s [{"text":" The game is a succession of 10 minutes cycles of two phases: a building phase during which all players are in survival mode and a collection phase during which the gamemode is adventure. The emerald generator in the first tower only works during the collection phase. The collected emeralds are removed from the players' inventory during the building phase and converted into points.","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Players get as many points as they have emeralds in their inventory, except if they stand on the obsidian platform in the second tower. The players sharing a spot on the platform get as many points as there are emerald in the combined inventories of all players present on the platform. Therefore, if 3 players stand on the platform with 10 emerald each in their inventory, they all get 30 points. This is the main incentive to share resources and play together. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Furthermore, a 5 points reward is given for each player kill during the collection phase. This is the main incentive to play alone. Be careful however, because the reward turns into a penalty during the building phase! This way hunted players can breathe and prepare for the next cycle. Additionaly, there is a constant 5 points penalty for dying. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Beside the towers, the game generates 3 houses with a villager where the players can trade emeralds for special items/resources. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Additionally, 10 invisible emererald generators are dispersed on the map. They spawn emeralds at a smaller rate than the tower generator but can be useful if enermy players control the towers. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Each cycle ends with a countdown to annouce the removal of emeralds from the players' inventory. Starting from the 3rd cycle there is a 30 percent chance that the last cycle is announced. There is a maximal limit of 6 cycles so that a game is never more than an hour long. The points are computed at the end of the last cycle and the winner is announced right after. If two players or more have the same score at the end of the game, the winner is randomly selected between them. ","color":"aqua"}]

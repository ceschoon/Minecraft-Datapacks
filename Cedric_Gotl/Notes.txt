Minecraft datapack: Cedric_Gotl "Guardians of the lodestones"
=============================================================

WORK IN PROGRESS

------------------------------------ About ---------------------------------

Game for two teams where one team must defend its lodestone and destroy 
the other team's one.


------------------------------------ Usage ---------------------------------

1. Put datapack in the server's datapack folder.

2. Reload datapacks with the "/reload" command.

3. Go to the location in the minecraft world where you will play the game.

4. Use the "/function gotl:start" command to start the game.
   The main namespace is gotl, the others correspond to submodules.
   The module "lodestones" can be used alone (/function lodestones:start).

5. If you want to stop the game prematurely, you can simply /reload

In case you encounter trouble, remove other datapacks to be sure there is 
no conflict. Keep however the compass datapack next to this one. You may 
also want to reload this datapack individually right after executing the
"/reload" command to be sure this one is reloaded last.

The banner can be used to select the location where the lodestone will be placed. The team has 10 minutes of preparation time to decide where to place the lodestone. After this time period the lodestone is automatically placed at the feet of a random team member (if not already placed) and players get a compass pointing to the other team lodestone. The lodestone is the default location where players will respawn.","color":"aqua"}]

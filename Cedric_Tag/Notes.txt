Minecraft datapack: Cedric_Tag
==============================


------------------------------------ Plan ----------------------------------

Game modes: (each has its own namespace)
	stag 	simple tag: 1 player must tag someone else to get rid of tag (victim gets the tag)
	rtag	reverse tag: keep tag as long as possible (killer gets the tag)
	rrtag	randomized reverse tag: random selection of tag holder (current mode)

Parameters:
	worldborder size (user should change it himself ??)
	strength 255 (user should place command block instead ??)
	glowing (user should place command block instead ??)
	max tag holding time (time for win/loose)

Modifications to existing code:
	increase time in seconds?
	Make a git repo on GitHub

----------------------------------- Dev TODO -------------------------------

tag:
	change time to seconds

stag:
	implement using teams?

rtag:
	would be very nice but how to implement??
	with teams each player in his own team ?
	by detecting player closer to the killed one ?

rrtag:

rrtagx:
	strength 255 for hunters
	smaller worldborder
	less time to win (e.g. 12000)

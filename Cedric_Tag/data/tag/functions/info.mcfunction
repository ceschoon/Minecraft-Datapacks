tellraw @s [{"text":" This minigame comes with 3 variants. The first variant (basic) is the naked game without any setup of the map or alteration of the players inventory. There is however all the tag game mechanics. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" The \"tag\" consists of a scoreboard display that increments every second for the tagged player. The tagged player is indicated by the gold color. If the tagged player dies from natural causes, the tag is given randomly to one of the players with the lowest score.","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" In the second variant (normal) worldborders are set to create a 400x400 map. The inventory/effects of the players are cleared before the game starts. The winner is the first player to stay tagged for more than 1200 seconds (20 minutes). ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" In the third variant (mini) the map is only 100x100 blocks wide. All players have the ability to kill the others in one hit with bare hands. The game is played at a faster pace and the threshold to win is thus set to 600 seconds (10 minutes). ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Each player gets a compass to track the runner. You must drop the compass on the ground to record the current location of the runner. You need to drop the compass each time you want to update his position. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" All variants of the tag game can be played in one of two gamemodes: The first (reverse tag) consists in keeping the tag for as long as possible (first to 1200/600 seconds) and in the second you must get rid of the tag as quickly as you can. The winner in the second gamemode (simple tag) is the last player tagged less than 20 minutes (or 10 depending on the variant). ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" Kills are rewarded in the following manner: In reverse tag, each kill adds 60 to the score when the map is of normal size (10 in the mini variant). In the simple tag gamemode the same amounts are subtracted to the score and the kill points are granted only for players with scores above 1200 (600 in the mini variant). This is meant to provide comeback strategies for loosing players. In the same spirit, the rewards in reverse tag are only granted to players of scores below 600 (300 in the mini variant).

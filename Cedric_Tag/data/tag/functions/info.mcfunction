tellraw @s [{"text":" This datapack features 3 variants of a tag game. The first variant (basic) is the naked game without any setup of the map or alteration of the players inventory. There is however all the tag game mechanics: The players must chase a \"tagged\" player to kill him and claim the tag for themselves. ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" The \"tag\" consists in a scoreboard display that increments every second for the tagged player. If the tagged player dies from natural causes, the tag is given randomly to one of the players with the lowest score. The winner is the first player to stay tagged for more than 1200 seconds (20 minutes). ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" In the third variant (mini) the map is only 100x100 blocks wide. All players have the ability to kill the others in one hit with bare hands. The game is played at a faster pace and the threshold to win is thus set to 600 seconds (10 minutes). ","color":"aqua"}]

# Minecraft Datapacks

## Summary of all packs

| Datapack | What it is for |
|---------|---------|
| **Cedric_Compass** | Compass module, simple tracking of one player |
| **Cedric_Hunt** | Manhunts |
| **Cedric_Lodestones** | !Work in progress! |
| **Cedric_Tag** | Suite of various tag games |


## Installation

The datapacks must be installed in the "datapacks" folder of the server. Then all datapacks must be reloaded in game using the "/reload" command.

To start a game, the general procedure is to first reload the specific datapack, to ensure that it has been loaded last. Then the game can be started with the corresponding start function. For example to play a manhunt you must execute the following commands:

> /reload <br>
> /function hunt:reload <br>
> /function hunt:start <br>

You can always end a game prematurely using the "/reload" command.

More specific installation instructions are given in the "Notes.txt" file within each datapack's folder.

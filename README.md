## Installation

The datapacks must be installed in the "datapacks" folder of the server. Then all datapacks must be reloaded in game using the "/reload" command.

To start a game, simply use the start function of the right datapack. For example to play a manhunt you execute the following commands:

> /reload <br>
> /function hunt:start <br>

You can always end a game prematurely using the "/reload" command.

More specific installation instructions are given in the "Notes.txt" file within each datapack's folder.

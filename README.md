## Installation

The datapacks must be installed in the "datapacks" folder of the server. Then all datapacks must be reloaded in game using the "/reload" command.

Once in a while a message appears in chat, giving the option to display the minigame menus. You can simply click to start a game.

You can always end a game prematurely by reloading the corresponding datapack.
